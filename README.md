### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ“– Iâ€™m currently studying at M1 level at the computer science departement of Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure Paris-Saclay
- ðŸŽ® Iâ€™m currently working on my video games [LemnosLife](https://github.com/Benjamin-Loison/LemnosLife), [Among Us decentralized](https://github.com/Benjamin-Loison/Among-us-decentralized), [Travian blockchained](https://github.com/Benjamin-Loison/Travian-blockchained) and implementing a [Bitcoin fork](https://github.com/Benjamin-Loison/Mining-in-Logarithmic-Space) according to ["Mining in Logarithmic Space" paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/623.pdf)
- ðŸ’¬ Take a look at my [Curriculum Vitae](https://lemnoslife.com/CV-EN.pdf)
<!-- github link even by forcing raw would be cleaner and could instead redirect CV-EN.pdf on my website to the GitHub -->
<!-- could add a link in my online CV to the French/international version-->
